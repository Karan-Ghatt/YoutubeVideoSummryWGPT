hello my name's Adam I'm the co-founder
of relum and in this video I'm going to
be giving you a demo of the really
library site Builder so let's jump in
okay so I've created a new project and
I'm going to title it demo project
now the first thing that you'll see when
creating a new project is the generate
sitemap modal and the reason for this is
because generating a site map with the
help of AI is a great way to start any
website project and get the creative
juices flowing
in the sitemap model there are two
inputs that lead to the AI output and
the first input is a description of the
company the website is for now you can
describe the company in a sentence or
two but we do encourage you to provide
as much detail as possible here the more
detail you put in the company
description the Richer the output so
provide lots of context and be as
specific as possible
for this demo I'm going to be using one
of the examples which is for a company
called rebank which is a digital Bank
and then for the number of pages which
is an approximation I think five pages
is a good number when thinking about
this number I like to consider the
budget of the project and the type of
company I'm designing for I think for a
digital Bank five may be on the Lower
Side maybe not if it's a startup but
I'll just roll with this for now and
press generate
as you can see it is generating the home
page with suggestions for components and
content and it has suggested some pages
as part of the sitemap too
once the sitemap has been generated I
can either continue generating the
remaining pages I can close this modal
and edit the sitemap I can rerun this or
I can discard this
to be honest I feel like the AI could do
a better job so I'm going to rerun this
again and see what I get
sweet that's looking much better next
thing I'm going to do is continue
generating the page and add a contact
page because I feel like that's what's
missing currently from the sitemap
and I'll press generate for the contact
page too
and So within a couple of minutes I have
a complete sitemap that provides an
outline for each page with each section
and the next thing I'm going to do is
show you how to edit a sitemap
so let's take a look at the about us
page specifically at first glance I
probably don't want a client logos list
section here but I could definitely use
this for the home page so I'm going to
move it to the home page by dragging and
dropping the section
now I'm liking the about us page but I'd
like to get AI to suggest a second
version to do this I'm going to
duplicate the page delete the sections
and generate the page again
what I love about AI is that it not only
generates ideas in seconds but it also
does a lot of the heavy lifting for you
at reeling We Believe AI will change the
way we work and design and here's an
example of that and actually I do prefer
that so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to delete the original Page by
using the delete shortcut I can also
right click to delete the page 2.
when it comes to editing the sitemap you
can move pages around by dragging and
dropping them as I'm doing here with the
pricing page
and you can also edit the text for each
section for example I'm going to edit
this featureless section by changing
saving goals to say quick transfers
great you can also edit the section
title as well but I'll leave that as is
for now
and that's how you create a site map in
just a few minutes
it is now time to convert this sitemap
into a wireframe and it is super easy to
do that
so what I'm going to do is click the
wireframe button at the top of the page
which takes me to a wireframe view where
I have a list of each page in my sitemap
and a generated wireframe for each page
that is using the components from
realoom library
you can also see that AI has written the
copy for me too and the copy is based on
this section titles and descriptions and
Maps perfectly to the components
as you can see here I have a feature
section that's highlighting the
convenience of managing money on the go
with rebank and based on this context AI
has chosen a feature section with some
text on the left and an image on the
right which I could imagine being an
image of rebank's app UI
but if I wanted to change the layout of
a section I could do that by replacing
the component with other suggested
components for this example I'm going to
pick layout 16 which includes a list
where I can call out some key benefits
[Music]
I'm also going to replace this logo
section I think I would prefer something
that has a single row of logos that Loop
just like that
you can also move sections around in the
wireframe by using the up and down
arrows on your keyboard or by dragging
and dropping the sections
[Music]
you can also add new sections and choose
from over 1 000 re-loom components
for this wireframe I might add a
testimonial section here because I feel
like that's missing from the page let me
just check the rest of the page first
okay that's why I might still add a
testimonial section here maybe just a
single testimonial section
and then I'll go to the section details
panel and make sure that the section
title and section description makes
sense before I generate copy for this
section
great
and I'm going to copy the section and
move it so that we have a testimonial
sandwich
and then I might just delete the
testimonial below
and so at this point I've completed my
wireframe for the home page and let's
just imagine that I've edited the other
Pages too
okay so at this point I have created an
awesome wireframe and I want to share it
with a client there are a few ways that
you can do this the first way is to just
share a view only link so if you copy
this link and send it to the client the
client will be able to view a view only
link that they cannot edit they can just
view so this is a nice way of sort of
taking the client through your project
another way that you can share this
would be to export this into figma and
by exporting this into figma you can
continue designing and editing and
building upon the work that was done
inside of the site buildup and then you
can share with your client so I'm going
to show you next how to export into
figma
so what I'm going to do is click the
export button and click export to figure
and there'll be a modal here explaining
that I'll need to install the railing
Library figma plugin to export the
wireframes in sitemap so you'll need to
go ahead and do that
I already have the plugin installed so
I'm going to go over to figma and open
it
and here we see a list of projects that
have been saved to my real Loom account
now I'm going to select the demo project
which is the project I've been working
out of and as you can see I can add the
sitemap and wireframe to the canvas
I'll go ahead and click add wireframes
and as you can see it has added every
single wireframe from the demo project
to the canvas
it's also important to note that I'm
using the realum library figma kit file
so that I can sync the wireframes with
the Styles and components from this file
this enables me to easily update The
Styling across all the wireframes for
example if I go back to the blocks demo
page you will see that the button has
been updated to have round edges if I go
back to the style guide page where the
button component lives I can change the
button color to Blue
and that change is made across all the
wireframes
another cool thing is that each section
of the wireframe is built using the
components from the real and Library
figma kit which have been built by our
team of figma experts they're built with
auto layout which makes them super easy
to edit and because we've synced with
the components in this file I can change
the variance here which will change the
component used and keep the existing
copy which is a nice little feature
another cool feature of figma export is
that you can copy and paste individual
sections from the site Builder so let's
imagine that I want to replace the logo
section with a new component
once I replace the component I can right
click and press copy to figma
I can go back to figma open the plugin
again and click the paste button and
paste the clipboard into the space and
this will add the section to the canvas
and then all I need to do is paste that
section into the wireframe and because
it's using Auto layer it snaps perfectly
to place
next I'm going to show you how to export
to webflow now exporting to webflow is
even easier to export to webflow you
must ensure you're using the real and
Library style guide a quick way to find
the style guide is to visit The Reeling
Library website where you can find a
link to the star guide on each page in
the preferences drop down
I'm going to go ahead and clone this
style guide you'll need to clone the
style guide so that the class is used in
the components can sync with the classes
used in the style guide this will help
with rendering the components and also
will enable you to control styling at a
global level and keep your webflow
project more organized
and so once I have this style guide I
can go ahead and I can delete what's in
this page because I'm going to paste in
this entire page from the site Builder
to do this I'll select the page right
click and copy to webflow
and it will show me this modal telling
me that I need to go through the steps
that I've just shown you
I'm going to press OK I've got it
and I'm going to go to my webflow
project and paste in the page
and as you can see it has pasted it into
webflow
next thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to press publish so I can publish to the
internet and I'm going to view it inside
of the browser
and here I'm using a nice uncommon
component which looks pretty cool and
yeah basically everything looks how it
should look
and it's even mobile responsive
so now you can build upon this wireframe
with the power of webflow
and that's all I have for this demo I
hope you have a better idea on how the
really my recite Builder works and good
luck building your websites
