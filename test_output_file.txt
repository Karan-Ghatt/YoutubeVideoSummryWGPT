this is interesting uh yeah this is a uh
I hate showing Twitter beef by the way
this is too funny yeah I can I can help
this guy uh what is it Jason Smith he's
a massive shill yeah he's chill for the
Chinese government American dude right
yeah yeah which is Terraria you don't
usually get Americans no you do there's
an up a bit of an update let's be honest
yeah the majority are from Canada it's
true so you know foreigners who go to
China and they're treated differently
and probably treated as an important
person for the first time in their lives
so they absolutely fall in love with
that uh attention and the power and so
what they do is they decide to uh White
Knight for China for lack of a better
yeah I mean this is an official capacity
I think he works for cgtn or something
well it's not this is not a zugang um
yeah I mean he's yeah whatever yeah he's
doing like all those tours and the
propaganda tours and things so yeah
xinjiang and all that no he is a
journalist for Chinese State media oh
okay well either way he literally works
for cgtn whether it yeah he probably
does I mean most of them do actually as
a stringer at very no release no just
straight up okay well either way that's
neither here nor there yeah what's what
is here is the fact that the dude
non-stop posts Pro Beijing propaganda
every day he he is a host of The Bridge
podcast which is the Chinese government
podcast right okay so either way I mean
if you open it's like he's always like
posting yeah there he is he's posting
something like look how better China is
than America and look at the like all
the stuff so he posted this thing which
says China has rolled out exoskeleton
suits to the general public China is
living in 21.01 20 what is this new
 going around this is all the
propagandas for China right now are
saying China's living in 23 2 300 or
whatever they're making up these
ridiculous like future forward claims
bro have you been to China you work and
you work for China walk outside your
little bubble in Beijing have a little
look yeah yeah
so I couldn't help it so I said maybe
you should get one since simping for the
CCP proves that you obviously lack a
smile oh that's I and again I don't
usually post but this is such a stupid
yeah it's like three in the morning or
something I couldn't sleep and I just
looked at Twitter I'm like unscrew this
because you know that stuff's not
available to the freaking public anyway
yeah yeah even if it is it's not wide
widely used sure but it's yeah anyway
just had to put that in there it's in a
while that was a good wins yeah we could
do that every once in a while once in a
while that's a little treat yeah so
there's some crazy that just went
down they found a covid lab yeah a
clandestine secret illegal lab working
with infectious diseases over in
California and Reedley California yeah
which is I guess near Fresno or
something so yeah I learned about this
and the more I look into it the more sus
this is yeah this is really effed up in
some bullshits going down I reckon so I
actually I'm going to do an expose on it
yeah you're going to do a proper video
on it what might say I've already done
it yeah exactly I will release that yeah
um it's scary long like just a little
bit of info for you guys they found a
lot of um infectious diseases in there
that they were keeping like yeah you
know HIV and uh yeah freaking cholera
and all this stuff which you shouldn't
be hanging around it's very bad it's
like a re if you look you're going to
show it all you'll show how bad and
poorly equipped the so-called lab was oh
but there were like a thousand covert
mice in there yeah 900 yeah 900 yeah so
and those are mice that are engineered
to Catch and Carry covert and it's in
like a very insecure lab in the middle
of California very very sus and it was
actually in an abandoned building it was
actually found a while ago yeah supposed
to be anyway yeah you'll you'll do the
whole thing but that's that's something
that needs to be seriously looked at yes
seriously so this is a little meme
and uh what does it have to say
[Music]
so this is uh I go back yeah I'll go
back to yeah this is a uh a TV that
transforms into a psychotic like metal
villain Transformers former thing to
attack the person using it yeah because

phone from China so if you said Taiwan
